# multi-calendar-engine

This is the engine to build a multi-calendar component (part of @dhis/ui) that supports various calendars used around the world (i.e. Ethiopian, Hebrew, Islamic, Nepali etc..).

It relies on the [Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal) which aims to achieve, among other goals, full-support for non-Gregorian calendars.
